# ðŸš€ Prairie Genomics Suite v5 Enhanced - Comprehensive Changelog

**From Streamlit Plotly Issues to Advanced R Shiny Multi-Group Analysis Platform**

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Version History**

- **v4.x**: Original Streamlit implementation with basic DESeq2 analysis
- **v5.0 Enhanced**: Complete R Shiny reimplementation with advanced features
- **Release Date**: January 24, 2025

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Migration Overview: Streamlit â†’ R Shiny**

### **Why the Migration?**
The transition from Streamlit to R Shiny was initiated due to persistent plotly import issues in the Python environment. The user reported:
> "it is saying there is no module named 'plotly'"
> "the same error is occurring. ultrathink on the fix"
> **"try to implement R shiny instead"**

This led to a complete platform migration that ultimately resulted in a more powerful and feature-rich application.
