## üìÅ **Data Preparation Instructions**

### **Dataset 1: Your Gold Standard Experiment (Start Here)**

**What to Prepare:**

1. **Expression Matrix File**
   - **Format**: CSV, TSV, Excel, or RData
   - **Structure**: Genes as rows, samples as columns (we'll auto-detect if different)
   - **Content**: Raw count data (not normalized)
   - **Size**: Up to 100MB supported

   **Example Structure:**
   ```
   Gene_ID,Sample_01,Sample_02,Sample_03,Sample_04
   ENSG00000223972,45,67,23,89
   ACTB,12453,11892,13045,12234
   GAPDH,8934,9123,8745,9456
   ```

2. **Sample Metadata File**
   - **Format**: CSV, TSV, or Excel
   - **Required Column**: `Sample_ID` (must match expression matrix column names exactly)
   - **Recommended Columns**: `Condition`, `Batch`, `Replicate`

   **Example Structure:**
   ```
   Sample_ID,Condition,Batch,Replicate,Treatment_Duration
   Sample_01,Control,Batch1,1,0h
   Sample_02,Control,Batch1,2,0h
   Sample_03,Treatment,Batch1,1,24h
   Sample_04,Treatment,Batch1,2,24h
   ```

## üéØ **Ground Truth Information We Need**

Once you upload your data, the system will ask for your expert knowledge:

### **Experiment Assessment**
- **Experiment Type**: What type of experiment is this?
- **Confidence Level**: How confident are you in this classification? (1-10)
- **Design Challenges**: What issues did you encounter with this experimental design?

### **Analysis Parameters**
- **Significance Threshold**: What adjusted p-value cutoff did you use and why?
- **Fold Change Threshold**: What fold change cutoff did you use and why?
- **Parameter Rationale**: Why did you choose these specific parameters?

### **Biological Context**
- **Positive Controls**: List genes that should respond to your treatment
  - Example: `TP53, CDKN1A, BAX` (for DNA damage response)
- **Negative Controls**: List genes that should NOT change
  - Example: `ACTB, GAPDH, RPL13A` (housekeeping genes)
- **Expected Pathways**: What biological pathways should be affected?
  - Example: `Cell cycle, Apoptosis, DNA repair`
- **Known Issues**: What problems did you encounter and how did you solve them?

### **Results Validation**
- **Final Gene Count**: How many genes were significantly differentially expressed?
- **Key Findings**: What were your main biological conclusions?
- **Publication Status**: Published, submitted, in preparation, etc.?

## ‚úÖ **What Our System Will Test**

### **1. Auto-Detection Accuracy**
```r
# Our system says: "Cell line treatment, 95% confidence"
# Your assessment: "Correct - this is drug treatment on HeLa cells"
# Result: ‚úÖ Validation passed
```

### **2. Parameter Intelligence**
```r
# Our recommendation: padj < 0.05, FC > 2.0
# Your final choice: padj < 0.05, FC > 2.0  
# Result: ‚úÖ Perfect match

# Our recommendation: padj < 0.01 (tissue comparison)
# Your final choice: padj < 0.05 (worked better for your data)
# Result: üìù Learn from discrepancy - adjust algorithm
```

### **3. Error Prevention**
```r
# Our system: "WARNING: Only 2 replicates per group detected"
# Your experience: "Yes, this initially gave me low statistical power"
# Result: ‚úÖ Error prevention working correctly
```

### **4. Results Validation**
```r
# Our system: "Housekeeping genes stable ‚úÖ"
# Your experience: "GAPDH was actually variable in this experiment"
# Result: üìù Refine housekeeping gene detection
```

### **5. Quality Control**
```r
# Our system: "Sample clustering looks good ‚úÖ"
# Your experience: "Yes, replicates clustered well"
# Result: ‚úÖ QC system working correctly
```

## üîí **Data Security & Privacy**

### **Your Data is Protected:**
- **Local Processing Only**: Data never leaves your machine
- **No Cloud Storage**: Everything processed locally in R/Shiny
- **Complete Control**: You decide what (if anything) gets shared
- **Easy Deletion**: Remove all data when testing is complete

### **Optional Template Creation:**
- **De-identified Only**: No raw data, just workflow patterns
- **Your Approval Required**: You approve before any sharing
- **Attribution Control**: You decide level of credit/anonymity
- **Withdrawal Anytime**: Remove templates whenever you want

3. **Show diversity**: Different experiment types if available
4. **Real problems**: Data with actual issues you've encountered

### **Provide Rich Context:**
1. **Be specific**: "GAPDH was variable due to treatment effect on metabolism"
2. **Share reasoning**: "I used stricter p-value because of small effect sizes"
3. **Document journey**: "First analysis failed because I missed batch effects"
4. **Include biology**: "Expected cell cycle genes to be upregulated"

### **Think Like a Teacher:**
1. **What would you tell a student?** 
2. **What mistakes do people commonly make?**
3. **What key concepts are crucial to understand?**
4. **How do you troubleshoot when things go wrong?**
